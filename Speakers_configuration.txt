Bluetoothctl utility to set up Bluetooth connections between computers and Raspberry Pis.9. To pair bluetooth device with our raspberry pi we need to run bluetoothctl as a root in raspberry pi terminal and execute the following commands:

sudo bluetoothctl
agent on
default-agent
scan on (to find the bd adresse of the device, once it’s found —> scan off)
pair FC:58:FA:12:01:62
connect FC:58:FA:12:01:62
exit
aplay -D bluealsa:DEV=78:44:05:DA:56:65 sample2.wav (playing music)



Additional informations:
The Bluetooth agent is what manages the Bluetooth 'pairing code'. 
For our speakers Philips BT50 we’ve got bd adress : FC:58:FA:12:01:62.
hcitool scan - scanning bd directly in normal terminal
remove FC:58:FA:12:01:62 - removes pairing
